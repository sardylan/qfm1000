qFM1000 is a simple tool for editing channels and configuration parameters saved into the 24C16 EEPROM that
you can find mounted inside any Philips FM1000 like radio.

It's based on the Qt/C++ cross-platform framework and can be built using cmake in Linux, Windows, or MacOS with gcc,
CLang or Visual Studio.
